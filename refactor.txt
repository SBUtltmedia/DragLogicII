Key Scalability Issues

   1. Global State Management (`globals.js`):
       * Problem: The application's state (e.g., firstOperandWFF,
         currentScopeLevel, subGoalStack) is managed through a large
         number of global variables. This is the most significant
         scalability bottleneck.
       * Impact: Global state makes the application's data flow hard to
         trace and debug. Any part of the code can modify the state at
         any time, leading to unpredictable behavior and bugs that are
         difficult to reproduce. It also makes it nearly impossible to
         implement features like saving/loading state or undo/redo
         functionality.

   2. Tight Coupling:
       * Problem: The modules are highly dependent on each other. For
         instance, drag-drop.js directly calls functions in proof.js and
         ui.js. This means the drag-and-drop logic is aware of the
         specific implementation details of the proof and UI systems.
       * Impact: Tight coupling creates a "domino effect" where a change
          in one file can cause unexpected breakages in others. This
         slows down development, increases the risk of introducing bugs,
          and makes the codebase resistant to change.

   3. Mixed Concerns (Logic and Rendering):
       * Problem: Application logic is frequently mixed with UI
         rendering code. For example, the addProofLine function in
         proof.js is responsible for both updating the internal proof
         state and creating the corresponding HTML <li> element.
       * Impact: This mixing of concerns makes it difficult to change
         the UI without potentially breaking the core application
         logic, and vice-versa. It also hinders the ability to create
         different UIs for the same logic (e.g., a mobile version) or
         to test the logic independently of the DOM.

   4. Monolithic Files:
       * Problem: Some files, particularly drag-drop.js, have a very
         large number of responsibilities, handling the logic for
         dragging and dropping variables, formulas, proof lines, and
         rules.
       * Impact: Large, monolithic files are hard to navigate,
         understand, and maintain. Splitting them into smaller, more
         focused modules would improve readability and make the code
         easier to manage.

  Recommendations for Improved Scalability

  To address these issues and prepare the application for future
  growth, I recommend the following architectural changes:

   1. Centralize and Encapsulate State:
       * Refactor the code to eliminate global variables. Consolidate
         all application state into a single, well-defined object (a
         "state store").
       * Implement a clear pattern for state management. Instead of
         modifying the state directly, use dedicated functions (i.e.,
         "actions" or "mutations") to make changes. This creates a
         predictable, one-way data flow. For a larger application, a
         lightweight state management library could be considered.

   2. Decouple Modules with an Event-Based System:
       * Introduce an event bus or a publish/subscribe pattern. Instead
         of modules calling each other directly, they would communicate
         by emitting and listening for events.
       * Example: When a formula is dropped on a rule, drag-drop.js would
          emit a formulaDroppedOnRule event with the relevant data. The
         rules.js module would subscribe to this event and execute its
         logic, without drag-drop.js needing to know about rules.js at
         all.

   3. Separate Logic from Rendering:
       * Adopt a more declarative approach to rendering. The UI should
         be a "function of the state."
       * Create a dedicated render() function that takes the current
         application state as input and updates the entire UI to match
         that state. This function would be called every time the state
         changes. This approach is central to modern UI frameworks (like
          React or Vue) and dramatically simplifies UI development and
         debugging.

   4. Increase Modularity:
       * Break down large files like drag-drop.js and rules.js into
         smaller, more specialized modules. For example, drag-drop.js
         could be split into wff-drag-handler.js,
         proof-drag-handler.js, etc.

  By implementing these changes, the application will become more
  robust, maintainable, and easier to extend in the future.
