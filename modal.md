Of course. Implementing a natural deduction system that correctly enforces the rules for different modal logics is a fascinating challenge. The key lies in precisely defining the constraints for each system, especially concerning how the main proof area interacts with "strict" or "boxed" subproofs.

Here is a guide for you, the programmer, detailing the new interface items and logical constraints required for each of the major normal modal logics.

### A Programmer's Guide to Implementing Modal Inference Rules

This document outlines the necessary additions and constraints for your logic game's interface to support the modal systems K, D, T, B, S4, and S5. The core of the implementation will revolve around managing two types of derivations: the main proof and "strict subproofs."

A **strict subproof** is the formal mechanism for proving necessary truths (formulas beginning with `□`). In your interface, this is the "boxed" area of the proof constructor. The fundamental difference between the modal systems lies in what new inference rules are available in the main proof and, crucially, what information is allowed to be imported from the main proof into a strict subproof.

#### General Constraints for All Systems

Before detailing the specific systems, two universal rules must be enforced:

1.  **Premises and WFFs Cannot Enter Strict Subproofs:** The initial premises of a proof represent contingent truths. They are considered true in the "actual world" of the proof but are not guaranteed to be true in the arbitrary "possible world" that a strict subproof represents. Therefore, there must be a global constraint preventing any initial premise from being dragged into or used within a strict subproof. The only way to bring information in is via a specific "importation rule" for the selected modal system.

2.  **Isolation of Subproofs:** Standard natural deduction rules (like Modus Ponens, Conjunction Elimination, etc.) can only operate on lines that are within the same subproof or in a containing, unclosed subproof.[1, 2] A strict subproof is a special, more isolated context where this is even more restrictive.

### System K: The Foundation

System K is the weakest normal modal logic and provides the baseline rules for strict subproofs.[1, 3]

  * **New Inference Rules:** None. System K only adds the mechanics for managing strict subproofs.

  * **Strict Subproof Rules & Constraints:**

      * **Necessity Introduction (`□I`):** This is the purpose of a strict subproof. If a user successfully derives a formula `φ` inside a strict subproof (which must be started with no initial assumptions), they can "close" that subproof. Upon closing, the interface should allow them to add the formula `□φ` to the parent proof.[1, 3]
      * **Importation Rule (`im`):** This is the only way to get information into a strict subproof in System K.
          * **Rule:** If a formula of the form `□φ` exists on an accessible line *outside* the strict subproof, the user is permitted to drag the formula `φ` (with the `□` removed) onto a new line *inside* the strict subproof.[1]
          * **Constraint:** The UI must enforce that only formulas starting with `□` can be used for importation, and the `□` must be stripped upon entry into the subproof.

### System D: Deontic Consistency

System D is a simple extension of K, typically used for deontic (obligation-based) logic.

  * **Inherits:** All rules and constraints from System K.

  * **New Inference Rules:**

      * **Rule (D) or `bd`:** Add a new rule to the inference panel. From a formula `□φ`, a user can derive `◊φ`.[1] This rule applies in the main proof or any non-strict subproof.

  * **Strict Subproof Rules & Constraints:** No changes. The importation rule remains the same as in System K.

-----

### System T (or M): The Logic of Truth

System T is the most common system for alethic (truth-based) necessity, establishing that what is necessary is true.

  * **Inherits:** All rules and constraints from System K.

  * **New Inference Rules:**

      * **Rule (T) or `ni` (Necessity Elimination):** Add a new rule to the inference panel. From a formula `□φ`, a user can derive `φ`.[1, 4] This is a powerful rule that applies in the main proof or any non-strict subproof.

  * **Strict Subproof Rules & Constraints:** No changes. The importation rule is the same as in System K (`im`: `□φ` outside becomes `φ` inside).

-----

### System B: The Brouwerian System

System B extends T by adding an axiom related to symmetry.

  * **Inherits:** All rules and constraints from System T.

  * **New Inference Rules:**

      * **Rule (B):** Add a new rule to the inference panel. From a formula `φ`, a user can derive `□◊φ`.[4]

  * **Strict Subproof Rules & Constraints:** No changes. The importation rule remains the same as in System T.

-----

### System S4: The Logic of Introspection

System S4 strengthens T with a rule governing iterated necessity, often used in epistemic logic (the "knows that one knows" principle).

  * **Inherits:** All rules and constraints from System T.

  * **New Inference Rules:**

      * **Rule (4):** Add a new rule to the inference panel. From a formula `□φ`, a user can derive `□□φ`.[4]

  * **Strict Subproof Rules & Constraints (Major Change):**

      * **Importation Rule (`im4` or `S4-Reiteration`):** The importation rule is strengthened.
          * **Rule:** If a formula of the form `□φ` exists on an accessible line *outside* the strict subproof, the user is permitted to drag the formula `□φ` *unchanged* into the strict subproof.[1, 5]
          * **Constraint:** The UI must now allow formulas starting with `□` to be imported *with* their `□` operator intact. This rule replaces (or technically, exists alongside) the weaker rule from K and T.

-----

### System S5: The Logic of Equivalence

System S5 is the strongest of these common systems and is often used for logical or metaphysical necessity. It simplifies iterated modalities significantly.

  * **Inherits:** All rules and constraints from System T. It is also an extension of B and S4.[4]

  * **New Inference Rules:**

      * **Rule (5):** Add a new rule to the inference panel. From a formula `◊φ`, a user can derive `□◊φ`.[4]

  * **Strict Subproof Rules & Constraints (Major Change):**

      * **Importation Rules (`im4` and `im5`):** S5 has the most permissive importation rules.
          * **Rule 1:** Like in S4, if `□φ` exists outside, it can be imported *unchanged* as `□φ` inside.[5]
          * **Rule 2:** If a formula of the form `◊φ` exists outside, it can also be imported *unchanged* as `◊φ` inside.[1, 5]
          * **Constraint:** The UI must be updated to allow both `□`-formulas and `◊`-formulas to be dragged into a strict subproof without modification.

### Summary for Implementation

| System | New Rules (Outside Strict Subproof) | Strict Subproof Importation Rules |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **K** | None | From `□φ` outside, you can add `φ` inside. |
| **D** | `□φ ⊢ ◊φ` | Same as K. |
| **T** | `□φ ⊢ φ` | Same as K. |
| **B** | `φ ⊢ □◊φ` (in addition to T's rules) | Same as K. |
| **S4** | `□φ ⊢ □□φ` (in addition to T's rules) | From `□φ` outside, you can add `□φ` inside. |
| **S5** | `◊φ ⊢ □◊φ` (in addition to T's rules) | From `□φ` outside, add `□φ` inside. <br> From `◊φ` outside, add `◊φ` inside. |

By implementing these distinct rule sets, your game will accurately capture the deductive power and unique constraints of each of these foundational modal systems.
